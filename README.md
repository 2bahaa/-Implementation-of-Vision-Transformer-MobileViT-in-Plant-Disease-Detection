# -Implementation-of-Vision-Transformer-MobileViT-in-Plant-Disease-Detection
As part of our graduation project, we developed an advanced AI-based system for early detection of plant diseases using the powerful MobileViT (Mobile Vision Transformer) architecture â€” combining the efficiency of CNNs with the contextual strength of transformers.

Our solution processes plant leaf images to accurately classify multiple disease types, enabling faster intervention and reducing crop loss. The model was trained and tested on a curated dataset, achieving high accuracy while remaining lightweight and deployable on edge devices â€” ideal for real-time agricultural applications.

ðŸ§  Key Highlights:

Utilized MobileViT for robust feature extraction and classification

Achieved high test accuracy with strong generalization on unseen data

Optimized for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile/IoT platforms)

Supports sustainable agriculture by enabling early and precise disease detection

This project contributes to smarter, AI-driven farming practices aligned with SDG 2: Zero Hunger and reflects our vision of using deep learning to support global food security.
